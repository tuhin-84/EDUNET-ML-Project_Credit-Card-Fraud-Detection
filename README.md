# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project is a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The model is trained on a dataset containing credit card transactions, where each transaction is labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate.
The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify new transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on the features of the transaction.
